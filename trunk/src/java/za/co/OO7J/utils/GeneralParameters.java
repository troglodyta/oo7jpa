 * Based on:
 * 
 * Original comment from OO7 creators:
 * 
 * parameters for generating design information fields
 * 
 * First parameters for dates. Each type of object has a distinct date range, to
 * make it easier to control the results of queries that compare dates.
 * Currently the important relationship is between assembly objects and
 * composite parts, since queries #5 and #6 ask for assemblies that use
 * composite parts with build dates later than the date for the assembly.
 * 
 * The overall picture is that composite parts are divided into two classes,
 * "old" and "young", such that we have the following picture:
 * 
 * ->---------old-------|---assembly----|------young------->
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * "Old" composite parts have build dates in this range.
 * 
 * assembly object have build dates in this range.
 * 
 * "young" composite parts have build dates in this range.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The constant "YoungCompFrac" determines the fraction of composite parts that
 * are "young" --- about 1(div)YoungCompFrac of the composite parts are young.
 * ("About" due to randomness in how the young parts are chosen.)
